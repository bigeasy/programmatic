# Programmatic Diary

```javascript
function (foo, fields, baz) {
    foo.forEach(function (item) {
        if ($.test(item.type == 'integer')) {
            _$field = (_$field & $sign) ? ($mask - _$field + 1) * -1 : _$field
        } else {
        }
    })

    $(fields = fields.forEach(function () {
    }))

    $.switch(index, function () {
        return $.forEach(function (racket) {
            return
        })
    })

    while (bite != $stop) {
        if (start == end) return start
        _$field += Math.pow(256, bite) * buffer[start++]
        $($direction < 0, bite--, bite++)
    }

}

function other ($) {
    var $, bits = (mask >>> (field.bits - pack.bits)).toString(16)
    unsigned = $reference
    unsigned = unsigned < 0 ? bits + unsigned + 1 : unsigned
}
```

Now that I think about it, why am I trying to survive minification? The route
I'm taking now would require the user to install a parser. That's more
complicated than minification isn't it?

## Concerns and Decisions

 * Decided that I do not care about minification. Realized, too, that a
 generated generator that contains an AST would be minification safe.

## Generator Output

Generators can be output, written to file, then distributed as source. They can
also be unit tested.
